### What my LinkedIn says about me

"Give me a data visualization task, along with a train ticket, and I will work tirelessly".

I am a technically skilled, goal-oriented, independent scientist, and multidisciplinary communicator. Fascinated by the hidden messages concealed within data, I am enhancing my skillset to become a data scientist. 
Data science gives me the challenge, communication gives me the energy.
On one hand, I am drawn to the quantitative aspects of data science, seeking the excitement that comes from solving complex problems and uncovering insights through analysis. On the other hand, it is not enough to simply extract messages from data; it is crucial to effectively communicate them. The communicative aspect of data science fuels my passion for the field.
